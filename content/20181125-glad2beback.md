After a few years off not having the time or motivation to write and share thoughts, discovery or useless snippets ; I take the time to put this blog on Github pages.

Reading the last articles I couldn't help but lol :-)

I'm going to try taking the time to write the following articles:

* How I've helped a startup move from AWS S3 to an on-premise object storage platform powered by [OpenIO](https://github.com/open-io/oio-sds/)
* Write an old article on how I've built a *80Gbit/s* *live video streaming* platform for Free Mobile announcement
* How to use [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/) as a reverse proxy for your public-facing DNS server and protect them
* Complete the debootstrap how-to by adding the UEFI part
