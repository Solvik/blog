Since a few months, I've been inclined to test and use [Salt Stack][1].
I manage a lot a heterogeneous plateforms, but each one are composed of similar machines who does the same stuff.

For example, once three months, I'm being asked to install a new packages, configure a new printer on desktop machines of our datacenter's collaborators.
What a great use case :)


Introduction
----

Salt is like Puppet and Chef, which are also deployment and automation tools. I find it more lightweight and

Installation
----

It seems that Salt Stack is not yet in the official Ubuntu repositories

Things to do on your master host:

    :::shell
	apt-get install python-software-properties
	add-apt-repository ppa:saltstack/salt

	apt-get update
	apt-get install salt-master

Things to do on your client host:

    :::shell
	apt-get install python-software-properties
	add-apt-repository ppa:saltstack/salt

	apt-get update
	apt-get install salt-minion

By default a Salt Minion will try to connect to the DNS name "salt"; if the Minion is able to resolve that name correctly, no configuration is needed.
If the DNS name "salt" does not resolve, you need to edit **/etc/salt/minion**

    :::shell
	master: 192.168.0.2


Restart everything

Master

    :::shell
	/etc/init.d/salt-master restart

Minion

    :::shell
	/etc/init.d/salt-minion restart


Communication
----

Communications bettwen the Master and your Minions is done via [AES encryption][2]. But to communicate, your Minion's key must be accepted by the Master

List all keys:

    :::shell
    $ salt-key -L
	Accepted Keys:
	Unaccepted Keys:
	NOC1-VTY2
	NOC2-VTY2
	NOC3-VTY2
	NOC4-VTY2
	Rejected Keys:

Accept all keys

    :::shell
	$ salt-key -A

Accept one key

    :::shell
	$ salt-key -a NOC1-VTY2

If you list your keys again you should get an output like this:

    :::shell
    $ salt-key -L
	Accepted Keys:
	NOC1-VTY2
	NOC2-VTY2
	NOC3-VTY2
	NOC4-VTY2
	Unaccepted Keys:
	Rejected Keys:

You can now test the communication between your Master and one of all of your Minions


	:::shell
	$ salt 'NOC1-VTY2' test.ping
	NOC1-VTY2:
		True
	$ salt '*' test.ping
	NOC3-VTY2:
		True
	NOC4-VTY2:
	    True
	NOC1-VTY2:
		True
	NOC2-VTY2:
		True


Deployment
----

Now, I want to be able to add another computer to our NOC team without having to push manually all the configurations (NIS/NFS/packages etc)

There is two major things, the directive **file_roots** and the file **top.sls**
According to the [documentation][3], SLS (or SaLt State file) is a representation of the state in which a system should be in.


file_roots
####

In your **/etc/salt/master** file, you need to uncomment the file_roots directive. It defines the location of the Salt file server and the SLS definitions.
Mine look like this

    :::config
	file_roots:
	  base:
        - /srv/salt/


After this modification, restart your server


top.sls
####

Doing specific stuff to specific machines in the main purpose of Salt.
This is defined within the **top.sls** file.

This can be done by:

| Ways | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| Globbing | "webserver*prod*" |
| Regular Expressions | "^(memcache&#124;web).(qa&#124;prod).loc$" |
| Lists | "dev1,dev2,dev3" |
| Grains | "os:CentOS" |
| Pillar | |
| Node Groups | |
| Compound Matching | |

This is my top.sls file:

    :::text
    base:
	   '*':
	     - nagios.client
	   'os:Ubuntu':
	     - repos.online
       '^NOC(\d)+-VTY2$':
	     - match: pcre
	     - yp.install
	     - yp.nsswitch
		 - nfs.mount_noc

base:
####

	:::text
    base:
	   '*':
	     - nagios.client

This block declare the global environment the minion must apply.
In this case, every machine will be assigned the nagios.client directive
It's going to execute */srv/salt/nagios/client.sls*

os:Ubuntu
####

This section matches machine using the Salt "grain" system, basically from system attributes.
It will execute */srv/salt/repos/online.sls*

'^NOC(\d)+-VTY2$'
####

This section matches using Perl regular expression feature
If the hostname of the machine matches this regex, it will be assigned the few directives
It will execute, */srv/salt/nagios/yp/install.sls*, */srv/salt/nagios/yp/nsswitch.sls*, */srv/salt/nagios/nfs/mount_noc.sls*
